# Security-Audit-Botium-Toys
<h1>Description</h1>
A security audit was performed on Botium Toys to align their operational practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit assessed the company's adherence to cybersecurity norms, identified potential gaps, and enhanced overall security posture of the organization.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department. 

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment. Then, perform an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.

<h3>Summary/Recommendations</h3>

- <a> Prompt attention is advised for critical findings related to PCI DSS and GDPR compliance due to Botium Toys' global online payment acceptance, including EU transactions. Embracing the principle of least permissions, SOC1 and SOC2 guidelines should be utilized to shape user access policies and overall data security as part of the audit's objectives. Ensuring disaster recovery plans and backups are in place holds significance for seamless business continuity during incidents. Incorporating an IDS and AV software into the existing systems aids risk identification and mitigation, especially considering manual monitoring needs for legacy systems. Enhancing physical asset security at Botium Toys' central location is recommended through locks and CCTV for protection and threat monitoring. While not an immediate requirement, introducing encryption, time-controlled safes, proper lighting, secured cabinets, fire prevention systems, and signage for alarm services will further elevate security measures. </a>
